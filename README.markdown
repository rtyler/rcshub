# RCS Hub

## This is a stupid idea


This stupid idea is currently being coordinated in [this project on
Teambox](https://teambox.com/projects/rcshub). There's a lot of pieces that
still need to be implemented to make the grand-stupid-vision work.

Currently there is/are:

* No tests really. Spent some time with [cucumber](http://cukes.info) then dropped it for cowboy coding
* A couple really crappy haml templates
* No actual connection between the Git->RCS importer and the "clone" link
* More issues [on Teambox](https://teambox.com/projects/rcshub)


### Thanks

* `ryanf` from the `#ruby` channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net) for
  suggesting the [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) gem.
